    <h1>
      O Come, All Ye Faithful
    </h1>
    <p>
      O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant!<br />
      O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem<br />
      Come and behold Him<br />
      Born the King of Angels<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      Christ the Lord!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      God of God, Light of Light<br />
      Lo, He abhors not the Virgin's womb<br />
      Very God<br />
      Begotten, not created<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      Christ the Lord!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation<br />
      Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!<br />
      Glory to God<br />
      All glory in the highest<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      Christ the Lord!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning<br />
      Jesus, to Thee be glory given<br />
      Word of the Father<br />
      Now in flesh appearing<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      O come, let us adore Him<br />
      Christ the Lord!<br />
    </p>

    <h1>Jingle Bells</h1>
    <p>
      Dashing through the snow<br />
      In a one-horse open sleigh<br />
      O'er the fields we go<br />
      Laughing all the way<br />
      Bells on bobtails ring<br />
      Making spirits bright<br />
      What fun it is to ride and sing<br />
      A sleighing song tonight<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingle bells, jingle bells<br />
      Jingle all the way<br />
      Oh, what fun it is to ride<br />
      In a one-horse open sleigh, hey<br />
      Jingle bells, jingle bells<br />
      Jingle all the way<br />
      Oh, what fun it is to ride<br />
      In a one-horse open sleigh<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the ground is white<br />
      And the night is young<br />
      Take the sleigh tonight<br />
      And join us in this song<br />
      Just get a bobtailed bay<br />
      Get ready for a run<br />
      Then hitch him to a sleigh<br />
      And now we’ll have some fun!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingle bells, jingle bells<br />
      Jingle all the way<br />
      Oh, what fun it is to ride<br />
      In a one-horse open sleigh, hey<br />
      Jingle bells, jingle bells<br />
      Jingle all the way<br />
      Oh, what fun it is to ride<br />
      In a one-horse open sleigh<br />
    </p>
    <h1>Silent Night</h1>
    <p>
      Silent night, holy night!<br />
      All is calm, all is bright.<br />
      Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child.<br />
      Holy infant so tender and mild,<br />
      Sleep in heavenly peace,<br />
      Sleep in heavenly peace<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent night, holy night!<br />
      Shepherds quake at the sight.<br />
      Glories stream from heaven afar<br />
      Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,<br />
      Christ the Saviour is born!<br />
      Christ the Saviour is born<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent night, holy night!<br />
      Son of God love’s pure light.<br />
      Radiant beams from Thy holy face<br />
      With dawn of redeeming grace,<br />
      Jesus Lord, at Thy birth<br />
      Jesus Lord, at Thy birth<br />
    </p>
